This is a forked project of BenchMarksGame for SNU UROP project.

Original source code:
https://salsa.debian.org/benchmarksgame-team/benchmarksgame

Run benchmarks by executing the shell script(run.sh), or manually execute the python script(./bencher/bin/bencher.py)
Please run 'quicksort_input_generate.py' before you run the quicksort benchmark(you don't need to do so if you run the shell script).
