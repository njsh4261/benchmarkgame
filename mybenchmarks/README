 OVERVIEW

 - mybenchmarks is an example of how to use the current benchmarks
    game PHP website scripts to show program measurements made with
    the Python bencher scripts.

 - Different sets of measurements are separated into different
    folders: for example, mybenchmarks/websites/linux
    and websites/macbook.

 - websites/index.html can link to those different measurements
   


 # 1 BACKGROUND

 - Over 15 years these scripts have been changed in many small
    and large ways, and the configuration files and script files 
    provide functionality that is no longer required. Be aware,
    there are cobwebs.

 - Some of the changes: multiple data sets / one data set, 
    drop-down menus / simple hrefs, dynamic pages / static pages
    / both, JavaScript / no JavaScript, external style sheet / 
    inline CSS, *etc*.

 - These scripts (originally written for PHP 4) are now run with
    PHP 7.4 (but have not been converted to PHP 7).

 - Most of the configurability never was used
    (for example mybenchmarks/websites/linux/config.php) 



 # 2 EXAMPLE

 $ cd ~/mybenchmarks/websites
 $ ??? php-7.4.0/bin/php -S localhost:8000

 http://localhost:8000/linux/java.php

 $ cat linux/java.php
 <?php
 ob_start('ob_gzhandler');
 require_once('config.php');
 $T = 'all'; $L = 'java'; $metaRobots = '';
 require_once(LIB_PATH.'compare.php');
 ?>

 - Define paths and some variables for the linux webpages.
   Specify test T and language implementation L.
   Filter the data and set template variables for 
   ~/mybenchmarks/lib/compare.php and compare.tpl.php

 - Compare.php mostly data; 
   compare.tpl.php mostly presentation.

   (See Brian E. Lozier's ~/mybenchmarks/lib/lib.php)



 # 3 GOTCHAS & USAGE

 - Data will be ignored if the test and language implementation
    are not listed in: linux/include.csv and / or macbook/include.csv
    and ~/mybenchmarks/desc/test.csv and ~/mybenchmarks/desc/lang.csv
       
 - Data will be ignored if the test and / or language implementation
    are listed in: ~/mybenchmarks/desc/exclude.csv

 - Various kinds-of presentation label are defined in desc/test.csv
    and desc/lang.csv

 - The 6th and 7th fields in desc/lang.csv define a default comparison
    (there should always be a default comparison) and a default 
    language implementation (empty if not the default implementation)

 - inline CSS, sorry.
    To change the CSS background color used in headings, find #macbook
    and / or #linux in the page $style and edit the background color.
    In lib/compare.php, lib/measurements.php, lib/performance.php and 
    lib/program.php.

 - Replace the example data with your data. 
    Delete the contents of websites/linux/code, linux/data, and version;
    and replace with your data and version files. Delete the contents of
    macbook/code, data, and version; and replace with your data and
    version files.

 - Change SITE_NAME and PLATFORM_NAME in linux/config.php and 
    macbook/config.php to names appropriate for your measurement sets.

    Change the mybenchmarks/websites/linux and macbook folder names to
    match the new SITE_NAME.

    Change the inline CSS to match the new SITE_NAME.
